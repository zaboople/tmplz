I will now included include.html, show url & onclick, and fill in url's "foo" slot:
[#Include include.html]
  [#Show url]
    [#Fillin foo]I filled it in![#Fillin]
  [#Show]
  [#Show onclick]
    [#Show OK][#Show]
    [#Fillin Value]I filled it in![#Fillin]
    [#Fillin Value2]Yes I did![#Fillin]
  [#Show]
[#Include]


I will now included include.html and only show url, nothing else:
[#Include include.html]
  [#Show url][#Show]

I will now included include.html and not do any of that:
[#Include include.html]
