This is template.html. 

This tests behavior of tmplz when a one-liner file is included, esp. as concerns
trimming of tags.

I will now include included1.html: 
  [$Include included1.html]
    [$Fillin type1]I filled in type1[$Fillin]
    [$Fillin type1Val]I filled in value1[$Fillin]
    [$Fillin type2]I filled in type2[$Fillin]
    [$Fillin type2Val]I filled in value2[$Fillin]
  [$Include]
