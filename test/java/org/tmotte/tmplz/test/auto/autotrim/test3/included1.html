
  This is included1.html. I will include included2.html five times; that template
  has only a simple one-line <input> tag: 

    These two rename "name" and "value":
    [$Include included2.html][$Rename name type1][$Rename value type1Val][$Include]
    [$Include included2.html][$Rename name type2][$Rename value type2Val] [$Include]  

    This include does not back up to the beginning of the line because it has an end tag
    (slots should be empty because they are not renamed to what parent template expects):
    [$Include included2.html][$Include]  

    These two, however, do back up to the beginning of the line, because they don't have end tags. Whatever,
    I don't see where you would do many single line includes like this. You almost always fillin/show/rename something.
    [$Include included2.html]
    [$Include included2.html]
