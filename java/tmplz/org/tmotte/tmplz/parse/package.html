  For internal use.  This contains the classes that Tmplz uses to parse html template files. There are four steps in parsing a template:
  <ol>
    <li>The template is converted from text to Tokens by the DocumentTokenizer, in the tokenize package.
    <li>The tokens are converted into "dum" nodes by the DocumentBuilder.
    <li>The dum nodes are "preprocessed" by the Preprocessor.
    <li>The dum nodes are turned into a Section by the TemplateBuilder.
  </ol>
