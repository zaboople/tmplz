  [Fillin Title]Extra Tags: Trim[Fillin]
  [Fillin Body]
    <p>The <b>Trim</b> tag is used to remove extra spaces and line breaks. For example, this: </p>
    <pre>
  <b>[$Trim]</b>
  1
  2
  3
  <b>[$Trim]</b></pre>
    <p>
    - will be parsed into this:
    </p>
    <pre>
  1 2 3</pre>
    <p>
    Note that there is a single space between each of the numbers above, so the whitespace is not completely removed; rather, it is reduced to a single space character. Usually this yields the most desirable results.
    </p>
    <h3>Placement</h3>
    <p>
    The Trim tag can be used as a top level tag, within any Section, and within any Fillin. It can also be used more than once within any of these contexts.
    </p>
    <h3>Auto-Trim</h3>
    <p>
    By default Tmplz trims extra space from tags that appear on lines by themselves. This can be turned off by a programmer using the <a href="../../../../javadoc/tmplz/org/tmotte/tmplz/TemplateManager.html#setAutoTrim%28boolean%29">TemplateManager.setAutoTrim()</a> API call.
