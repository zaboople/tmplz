    <p>
      A <em>Slot</em> specifies a place where information will be filled in later. Example:
    </p>
    <pre>
  I'm not sure how to explain this, so I'll let the computer do it: 
  <b>[$Slot Explain]</b> ...Hope that helps.</pre>
   <p>
    A Slot always has a <i>name</i>; here, the name is "Explain". An application developer can fill in this slot using the <code><a href="../../../../javadoc/tmplz/org/tmotte/tmplz/Section.html#fillin(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object,%20boolean)">Section.fillin()</a></code> method, or a <a href="fillin.html">Fillin</a> tag in another template can fill it in. A Slot that is not filled in will show up as blank when the template is printed.
    </p>


    <h3>Using the same name more than once</h3>
    <p>
    A given Slot name can be used more than once in a template. All slots with the same name receive the same value when filled in. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
  Dear <b>[$Slot Person]</b>,
  
  We are pleased to inform you that you've won a zillion dollars. What do you think 
  of that, <b>[$Slot Person]</b>? We bet you're pretty happy. And remember, <b>[$Slot Person]</b>, 
  you can't buy love, but you can buy a Ferrari.
  
  Yours,
  <b>[$Slot Sender]</b></pre>
    <p>Here, when "Person" is filled in, it will appear in three different places (the "YourBestFriend" Slot will receive a different value since it has a different name).</p>


  <h3>Sample Values</h3>
    <p>Occasionally it's useful to tag a Slot using the following format, which allows for a &quot;sample&quot; value:</p>
    <pre>
  <b>[$Slot MySlot]</b>Here is some sample text, which the Tmplz parser will discard.<b>[$Slot]</b></pre>
