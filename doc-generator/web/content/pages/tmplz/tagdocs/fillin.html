    A Fillin "fills in" a Slot in an included template. A Fillin is always nested within an Include, and it always has both a starting and closing tag. Consider the following template, named "formletter.html":

   The next template <i>includes</i> formletter.html and fills in its Slots:

    Hello there, Mr Difficult:
      We are writing to inform you that your software is giving us a headache. 
      Please stop doing that, Mr. Difficult.
    Best Wishes,
    Us
    P.S. This time we mean it.</pre>

  <a name="order"></a>
  <h3 id="orderHeading">Fillin order doesn't have to match Slot order</h3>
  <p>In the prior example, the Slots "Date" &amp; "Greeting" appear respectively, but the Fillins appear in the opposite order. This is perfectly okay.</p>
  <h3>Allowable Sub-Tags</h3>
  <p>
  A Fillin basically acts as a template unto itself, so it can contain all the same kinds of tags. This is a powerful feature since it means a Fillin can be used to insert a complex template inside the included contents of another template. 
  </p>
  
  <a name="destroy"></a>
  <h3 id="destroyHeading">Fillins "Destroy" Slots</h3>
  <p>A Fillin causes Slots to become "static", so that a given Slot can only be filled in only once; of course this rule does not affect other templates that Include the same content, since (as noted elsewhere) Include tags only affect the <i>copy</i> of the included template, not the original.</p>
  
  <a name="deep"></a>
  <h3 id="deepHeading">"Deep" Fillins</h3>
  <p>
  Recall that Slots can be nested inside of Sections. Sometimes we want to fill in a nested Slot on the assumption that something else will show the Section later on. To do this, the Fillin supplies a list of nested Sections and a final Slot, separated by period (".") characters. For example:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <b>[$Include xyz.html]   
      [$Fillin X1.X2.X3.YYY]</b>Blah<b>[$Fillin]   
    [$Include]</b></pre>
  <p>Here, when xyz.html is included, the parser will look for: Slot YYY <i>inside</i> Section X3 <i>inside</i> Section X2 <i>inside</i> Section X1... and fill it in with "Blah". So xyz.html ought to look something like this:
  </p>
  <pre>
    <b>[$Section X1]</b> 1 ...
      <b>[$Section X2]</b> 2 ...
        <b>[$Section X3]</b> 3 ...
          <b>[$Slot YYY]
        [$Section]
      [$Section]
    [$Section]</b></pre>
  <p>Note that if we want to fill a Slot that actually <i>has</i> a "." character in its name, the name can be quoted to prevent misinterpretation:</p>
  <pre>
    <b>[$Include xyz.html]   
      [$Fillin "A.Slot.Name"]</b>Etc.<b>[$Fillin]   
      [$Fillin S1.S2."A.Section.Name"."Another.Slot.Name"]</b>Blah<b>[$Fillin]   
    [$Include]</b></pre>
