  [Fillin Title]Extra Tags: Between[Fillin]
  [Fillin Body]
    <p>The <b>Between</b> tag can be used within a Section to add content <i>between</i> instances of the Section when it is shown multiple times. Consider the following template, named template.sql: </p>
    <pre>
    select <b>[$Section param][$Between]</b>,<b>[$Between]</b>?<b>[$Section]</b>
      from TableX </pre>
    <p>
    - which is included by this template:
    </p>    
    <pre>
    <b>[$Include template.sql]
      [$Show param/]
      [$Show param/]
      [$Show param/]
    [$Include]</b></pre>
    <p>
    - to produce this result:
    </p>
    <pre>
    select ?,?,?
      from TableX </pre>
    <p>In this example, the comma appears only between the question marks; if the question mark were shown only once, the comma would not appear at all. Usually it is best to use Between at the <i>beginning</i> of a Section, not the end.
    </p>
    <p>Note that Between currently does not allow sub-tags within itself.</p>
