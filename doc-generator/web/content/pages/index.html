      Welcome to my web site. You are likely here because you found it on my resume. This site hosts several semi-experimental projects that I have worked on over the years, and includes all of the source code, documentation and binary distributions.
    <p>
      Currently hosted are three projects. The first was the original project hosted on this site, which thus bears its name. Altogether they are:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="tmplz/index.html">Tmplz</a>, an API that can be used to generate web pages or any other kind of text file from templates;</li>
        <li><a href="pdfrpt/index.html">PDFRpt</a>, an API for PDF report generation;</li>
        <li><a href="klonk/index.html">Klonk</a>, a text editor featuring an unusual undo/redo algorithm
          that preserves all edit states.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although source code is available directly on this site, you can also peruse it on <a href="https://github.com/zaboople">GitHub</a>.
