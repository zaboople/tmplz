IMMEDIATE:

MEDIUM:
-I think remove and rename should allow closing /. It won't hurt anything.
-ShowRemove tag
-RemoveSections tag
-[$Comment] Tag? Would need to make sure to auto-trim them.
-Put in AttrSlot again? We need it for the <body> tag, so that we can inject random javascript.
  AttrSlot names the element, not the attribute.
-Make apps.SiteGenerator into a bona fide ant task.
-Macros: It would be really nice to have a single file that you could include, and then you grab widgets as macros. 
   BTW it would be nice to resolve relative paths to the included file, but ugh.
  [Define Macro P As]
     [Include foo.html] HEY maybe this could do the include when the define is eval'd, then the Include is relative to the macro definition.
  [Define]
  [Macro P]
    [FillinText]La la la la.[FillinText]
  [Macro P]

LOW:
-GZIP in ContentViewer application.
-Make Includes do auto-indent? The text included would indent to position of the include.
